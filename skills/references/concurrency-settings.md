# concurrency-settings

Audits Swift Concurrency build settings that add compilation overhead in Debug builds.

## ENVIRONMENT

Follow `../core/detect-environment.md`.

If Xcode < 14: display 🔴 warning, skip all automated changes — `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY` was introduced in Xcode 14.

## AUDIT

**Primary — scan `project.pbxproj` (or `.xcconfig` files) for Debug configuration:**

| Setting | Condition to flag | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY` | `complete` in Debug when `SWIFT_VERSION < 6` or targets are mixed | 🔴 Critical |
| `-strict-concurrency=complete` in `OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS` | Present in Debug configuration | 🔴 Critical |
| `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY` | `minimal` — fastest; report as info, no action | 🔵 Info |
| `SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY` | `targeted` — recommended for Debug; no action needed | ✅ OK |

**Swift 6 exception:** If all targets have `SWIFT_VERSION = 6`, `complete` is correct for the migration — do not flag.

**Secondary — scan source files (report only, no auto-change):**

| Finding | Threshold | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `@unchecked Sendable` conformances | > 10 occurrences | 🟡 Medium |
| `@MainActor` annotations (all usages) | > 20 occurrences | 🟡 Medium |

Detect with:
```bash
grep -r "@unchecked Sendable" --include="*.swift" . | grep -v "\.build" | wc -l
grep -rn "@MainActor" --include="*.swift" . | grep -v "\.build" | wc -l
```

## REPORT

Follow `../core/report-formatter.md` format.

```
🔴 [Critical] SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete (Debug)
Impact:         Full data race safety checking on every incremental build; measurably slower type-checking across the whole module
Recommendation: Set SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = targeted for Debug. Keep complete in your CI/Release scheme.
Example:        examples/concurrency-settings/
```

## ACTION

Mode: `apply with confirmation`

1. Print the full report.
2. If no findings, stop.
3. List proposed changes:
   ```
   Proposed changes to Debug configuration:
   - SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete  →  SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = targeted
   ```
4. Print: `Apply these changes to project.pbxproj? [y/N]`
5. If yes:
   a. Follow `../core/git-backup.md` before modifying `project.pbxproj`.
   b. Apply changes to Debug configuration only.
   c. Print: `✅ Concurrency settings updated. Clean build folder (Cmd+Shift+K) for changes to take effect.`
   d. Print: `⚠️ Verify your CI scheme still uses SWIFT_STRICT_CONCURRENCY = complete.`
6. If no: print `No changes made.`

**Note on `.xcconfig` files:** If the project uses `.xcconfig` files, modify those instead.

## COMPOSABILITY

Complementary to `/build-settings` — both modify Debug build settings in `project.pbxproj` but target different keys. Run separately; re-read the current `project.pbxproj` state before applying either to avoid stale-state conflicts.

If `/build-timeline` identified Swift Concurrency-heavy files as the slowest compiling units, run `/concurrency-settings` next.

## EXAMPLES

See `examples/concurrency-settings/` for before/after xcconfig files.
